Warning Thoroughly read all of the introductory pages (including this one!) before proceeding. Latest System Software The latest system software version is currently 11.15.0-47. If you have installed CFW in the past, it is highly recommended to follow Checking for CFW to make sure your custom firmware is up-to-date. What is custom firmware? Custom firmware (\"CFW\") is a full software modification to your 3DS, comparable to \"administrator access\" on a computer. It allows you to do anything that the 3DS is physically capable of doing, rather than being limited by whatever Nintendo allows you to do. Popular uses for custom firmware include: Bypassing the region lock, allowing you to play games from other regions Home menu customization, using community-created themes and badges Modification of games (\"ROM hacks\") through LayeredFS ) Save data editing, backup, and restore Emulation of older consoles, as well as native playback of DS and GBA games Installing your physical cartridges for digital use What does this guide install? This guide will install boot9strap + Luma3DS custom firmware on unmodified/stock 3DS/2DS devices. If you have installed custom firmware in the past, you should follow these instructions to find the correct upgrade path for your console. A modern, boot9strap/Luma3DS-based setup is preferred over older setups (arm9loaderhax, menuhax) because it is more stable for modern homebrew and continues to be supported by the community. What do I need to know before starting? While the risks of bricking have been minimized over the years, we are not responsible for anything that goes wrong with your device . Incorrect file placement will not brick your device, but reckless behavior might. This guide will work on every retail device in the Nintendo 3DS family of consoles (including the New 3DS series and the 2DS), regardless of region or firmware. Following this guide alone should not result in data loss, but SD card corruption is always a possibility. You should make a backup of your SD card contents if you have important data. You will need a working SD card in your 3DS, as well as the ability to write files to the SD card. The 3DS can read SD cards formatted as MBR/FAT32.

Is my device hackable? A: Yes Q: How do I update Luma3DS? A: Copy the boot.firm and boot.3dsx files from the latest release of Luma3DS to the root of the SD card, replacing any existing files. Q: I heard about this thing I have to pay for (Gateway, Sky3DS, etc). Is that something I need? A: No. boot9strap is a superior method of loading hax that runs early in boot. Q: How do I move saves from an existing Gateway setup to device installed games? A: See this Q: How risky is hacking my console? A: Bricks are now basically impossible unless you ignore/circumvent all safety checks. Q: Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this? A: Yes! Custom Firmware not only enables the Homebrew Launcher, but it also will give you hacks on all versions, which means you keep it forever, even with updates. Q: Can I use this to play games from other regions? A: Luma3DS supports Region Free patches, which enables users to install games from any region without any extra modification or steps. Q: Is it safe to update CFW SysNAND? A: Yes. This is safe, stop asking about it. Q: Where should I go for support? A: For support (in English), ask for help at Nintendo Homebrew on Discord . Q: Can I do this with a 4GB (or smaller) SD card? A: Yes! Q: Can I use a 128GB (or larger) SD card? A: Yes, but some users have reported slowdowns when using such large sizes. Note that you cannot format the card with exFAT; you need to format it with FAT32. Q: How do I move to a new SD card at the end of this? A: Just copy all the files to the new SD card. Q: Can I keep my NNID? A: If you start with an NNID and follow every step, you will end up keeping your NNID at the end. Q: What about System Transfers? A: Once you have completed the guide, you can system transfer to and from an B9S 3DS or 2DS exactly like you would a regular stock console or EmuNAND (you will lose any non-legitimate games/themes/DLC in the transfer; saves will stay even for games that are lost). Q: Can I do this without a computer (e.g. an Android phone)? A: All you need is the ability to put files on an SD card! Q: Help! Something bad happened and now I cannot boot...

This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads in the FIRM format using the Luma3DS chainloader. In this case, we use Luma3DS by LumaTeam to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.

The 3DS natively contains hardware to run such games, which is why VC Injects (which is what these are) are more desirable than emulators, as they automatically get better performance and compatibility. Running DS Games If you wish to run Nintendo DS (ie \"old DS\") games, you should use TWiLightMenu++ instead. This page will use Pokemon Emerald as an example to create a Virtual Console for the Game Boy Advance. Broadly speaking, the steps will not differ too much for other supported VC injectable consoles. Instructions To begin, open New Super Ultimate Injector for 3DS.exe, and create a new project. Once the project loads, import your legally dumped GBA rom by navigating to it in the window that appears when you click this button. Most of the information about your rom will be automatically prefilled. You may customise it as you wish. The options are reasonably self-explanatory, however if you are unsure, hover your mouse over a box or button for a short explanation of what it does. Most of the customisation is up to you. You can pick a long and short name, change the game icon, choose a title ID, modify the CIA banner, etc, etc. If you are lazy, most of these options can be left unchanged, but you should click \"Download title screen from database\" under icon settings and banner settings in order to get a half decent icon and banner image that you don't have to go hunting for. Importantly, at this time, there is no way to change button mapping for a VC inject. Under \"Edit content options\" at the bottom, you can apply a hard reset and or a sleep patch, if you want to do that. Once you have finished customising your rom, export it. It can then be installed to your console via FBI, which by this point you should already have. Here is an example of what the database title screen import looks like on a console. It's pretty good, for something that takes no effort on the user's behalf. Important VC injects count as Home Menu titles.

This is done by installing the 11.5.0 CTRTransfer image for the region you want to switch to. Note that region changing is almost completely unnecessary since Luma3DS supports out-of-region games and individual title Locale Emulation . Additionally, running NDS games with alternative out-of-region languages is supported by TWiLightMenu++ . To use the magnet links on this page, you will need a torrent client like Deluge . Note that if you have any payload files other than GodMode9.firm in the /luma/payloads/ folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a \"chainloader menu\" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select \"GodMode9\" for these instructions. Important This process will unlink your NNID from the system because it will no longer be compatible with your NNID. NNIDs are locked to the region of your device that created them and cannot be transferred between regions. After this process, you will not be able to access the eShop . This includes any feature that uses an NNID, such as game updates, purchasing DLC, or online play in certain games. Region changing to your original region will usually not fix this issue. Performing a CTRTransfer may break extended memory mode games (Monster Hunter, Super Smash Bros, Pokemon Sun/Moon) on Old 3DS/2DS devices. If this occurs, you will need to format the device (using TinyFormat or System Settings) to fix the issue. Note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably still not work for devices that it should work for. This is entirely to do with Nintendo's servers, and I really do not have any control over it. Additionally, note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably work for devices that it should not (such as some New 3DSs). The cause for this is currently unknown. Region changing using CTRTransfer (which this method uses) seems to cause reboot patches to break. The cause for this is unknown, but Old 3DS users, for now, will be unable to play extended memory mode games (such as Monster Hunter, Super Smash Bros, and Pok\u00e9mon Sun / Moon) until they format their devices. Important You MUST have already installed Luma3DS and boot9strap to use this.

This is done by installing the 11.5.0 CTRTransfer image for the region you want to switch to. Note that region changing is almost completely unnecessary since Luma3DS supports out-of-region games and individual title Locale Emulation . Additionally, running NDS games with alternative out-of-region languages is supported by TWiLightMenu++ . To use the magnet links on this page, you will need a torrent client like Deluge . Note that if you have any payload files other than GodMode9.firm in the /luma/payloads/ folder on your SD card, holding (Start) on boot will display a \"chainloader menu\" where you will have to use the D-Pad and the (A) button to select \"GodMode9\" for these instructions. Important This process will unlink your NNID from the system because it will no longer be compatible with your NNID. NNIDs are locked to the region of your device that created them and cannot be transferred between regions. After this process, you will not be able to access the eShop . This includes any feature that uses an NNID, such as game updates, purchasing DLC, or online play in certain games. Region changing to your original region will usually not fix this issue. Performing a CTRTransfer may break extended memory mode games (Monster Hunter, Super Smash Bros, Pokemon Sun/Moon) on Old 3DS/2DS devices. If this occurs, you will need to format the device (using TinyFormat or System Settings) to fix the issue. Note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably still not work for devices that it should work for. This is entirely to do with Nintendo's servers, and I really do not have any control over it. Additionally, note that occasionally the eShop will inexplicably work for devices that it should not (such as some New 3DSs). The cause for this is currently unknown. Region changing using CTRTransfer (which this method uses) seems to cause reboot patches to break. The cause for this is unknown, but Old 3DS users, for now, will be unable to play extended memory mode games (such as Monster Hunter, Super Smash Bros, and Pok\u00e9mon Sun / Moon) until they format their devices.

Ensure your flashcart is able to launch .nds files on your device before beginning. Some flashcarts may require firmware or \"kernel\" files to be copied to the flashcart SD card. Consult your specific flashcart's instructions for more information. Note that specific methods may have additional compatibility information. The usage of this exploit, regardless of flashing method, requires access to a small magnet if the target device is of a folding style (any 3DS family system that is not the old 2DS with a sleep switch). This is because the exploit requires your device to enter sleep mode while still having access to the buttons. Testing the magnet To test if a magnet will work, hold it on or around the (A)(B)(X)(Y) buttons while the device is powered on to see if it triggers sleep mode. If it does, both displays will go black as long as the magnet is held in that spot. Note that the flashcart will not be able to be used for its standard functions while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it (except for in the case of the Acekard 2i, which remains functional on NDS and custom firmware 3DS systems only ). This means that, for most flashcarts, it will not even display on the home menu. There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot flashing instructions to remove it from your flashcart when you are done. Important Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to brick a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported.

To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the DSiWare encryption key ( movable.sed ) for your device. We then use this DSiWare encryption key to decrypt a compatible DSiWare application and inject an exploit into it to run our own code (the exact exploit used will depend on your device's region). If this key were completely random, the encryption key would be impossible to break on current computing hardware. Fortunately, the first half of the key ( movable_part1.sed ) is actually mathematically related to your device's Friend Code, allowing us to break the encryption. For information on how Seedminer works, please see this presentation . This method uses a powerful graphics card to perform the calculations needed. A volunteer-run website is used for the purpose of assisting you with this method. Instructions Section I - Prep Work Insert your SD card into your computer Navigate to the Nintendo 3DS folder on your SD card Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see inside Nintendo 3DS Do not go inside any more folders If you see multiple folders with long, random names inside Nintendo 3DS without opening any other folders, perform the following: Rename the Nintendo 3DS folder to BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS Reinsert your SD card into your device and power on your device Wait for the device to generate the SD card data Power off your device and reinsert your SD card into your computer Navigate to the Nintendo 3DS folder on your SD card Copy the 32 character long name of the folder you see Delete the Nintendo 3DS folder Rename the BACKUP_Nintendo 3DS folder to Nintendo 3DS Paste your 32 character long folder name into a document you can reference later This folder name is also known as your \"ID0\" Power on your device Go to your Friend List (the orange Face Icon in the top row of your Home Menu) If you receive an error and are kicked out of the menu, you either must create a new Mii or your device cannot connect to Nintendo's servers (due to a ban or connection issues) Find your Mii profile, then find the \"Friend Code\" field on the top screen Section II - Seedminer Open Bruteforce Movable on your computer This site can automate the retrieval of movable_part1.sed (using a bot 3DS console) and the breaking of your device's DSiWare encryption (using a volunteer's computer to run Seedminer) If the site isn't working, join Nintendo Homebrew on Discord and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you Enter your device's Friend Code (with no spaces or dashes) into the \"Your friend code\" field Paste your device's 32 character long folder name into the \"Your ID0\" field Do not attempt to enter the ID0 by hand. Ensure the ID0 is entered correctly by copying and pasting it from where you saved it in the previous section Select \"Go\" If the site immediately goes to step 4, download your movable.sed file and continue with the next section When prompted, use the \"Register Friend\" button on your device to add the friend code of the bot 3DS console Wait for the site to update If it does not, wait a few minutes before refreshing the page once Once the site processes your information, you will be given the option to \"Continue\" or \"Do another device\". Click the green \"Continue\" button Wait for the remainder of the process to complete This is usually fast (1-5 minutes) but in some cases, can take up to half an hour During this process, the bot you added may not show up on your 3DS. As long as the website updates, this is not an issue If you are still waiting after half an hour, join Nintendo Homebrew on Discord and ask (in English) for someone there to assist you When the process has completed, download your movable.sed file from the site Keep this file as you will need it in the upcoming pages PicHaxx + universal-otherapp (Recommended) This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your movable.sed file to write a custom save file for Pok\u00e9mon Picross, which can then be used in conjunction with universal-otherapp to install custom firmware. This route requires the Pok\u00e9mon Picross application (free on eShop), and thus requires eShop access and a 3DS with a region of USA, EUR, or JPN. Continue to Installing boot9strap (PicHaxx) BannerBomb3 + Fredtool This method of using Seedminer for further exploitation uses your movable.sed file to create a custom DSiWare backup that exploits the system to dump system DSiWare. This route is only recommended if you are for some reason unable to follow the PicHaxx + universal-otherapp route.

To accomplish this, we use a tool called Seedminer to calculate the DSiWare encryption key ( movable.sed ) for your device. We then use this DSiWare encryption key to decrypt a compatible DSiWare application and inject an exploit into it to run our own code (the exact exploit used will depend on your device's region). If this key were completely random, the encryption key would be impossible to break on current computing hardware. Fortunately, the first half of the key ( movable_part1.sed ) is actually mathematically related to your device's Friend Code, allowing us to break the encryption.

For complete guides to homebrew and custom firmware for other devices, check out Hacks.Guide . Important Thoroughly read all of the introductory pages (including this one!) before proceeding. This guide is for retail (consumer purchased; not from the Nintendo Developer Program) consoles only ! If you have a developer (\"PANDA\") console, check out the Panda 3DS Hacks Guide . This guide is available in other languages! Click the icon at the top right of the page to change the language. Alternatively, click here to help to keep these translations up to date. This guide needs your help to seed these torrents! What is Homebrew? Homebrew usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. This includes homebrew tools, applications, games, and emulators. In many cases, running homebrew on your device is 100% free using just the Nintendo 3DS Sound app. There are also various other exploits in commercial games and the browser to get homebrew running. What is Custom Firmware? Custom Firmware (\"CFW\") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned titles that appear right on your HOME Menu. CFW can be set up on any console on any version (but may require additional tools / accessories for versions >11.3.0). What does this guide install? This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified 3DS from stock firmware to boot9strap powered Custom Firmware. On some versions, it utilizes homebrew as a stepping off point, but Custom Firmware is still the goal. boot9strap is the newest and best method of launching Custom Firmware that gives us nearly full control of the system only milliseconds into boot, which is similar to the effect of BootMii for the Wii. It gives us even earlier control than arm9loaderhax did, and, unlike standard sighax, boot9strap uses an NDMA overwrite exploit in order to gain Boot9 code execution. This means that any console running boot9strap is capable of dumping the console unique OTP ( OTP.bin ), the ARM11 bootrom ( boot11.bin ), and the ARM9 bootrom ( boot9.bin ). The benefits of boot9strap over other Custom Firmware launch methods are numerous, and as such it is recommended to use this guide over any other that relies on outdated software (such as menuhax + rxTools, arm9loaderhax, or even normal sighax). For information on how boot9strap works, please see this paper . For a list of each of the calculated sighax signatures, see this gist . What can I do with Custom Firmware? Play all game cards and eShop games, regardless of region Customize your HOME Menu with user-created themes and splash screens Use \"ROM hacks\" for games that you own Take gameplay and application screenshots Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators. (Works best with a New Nintendo 3DS) Install homebrew titles to your system, and have them appear on your HOME Menu Dump your game cards to a format you can install, and play them without needing the card New 3DS or New 2DS only: stream live gameplay to your PC wirelessly with NTR CFW Run many old Nintendo DS flash carts that were blocked long ago or never worked on Nintendo 3DS Safely update to the latest system version without fear of losing access to homebrew What do I need to know before starting? Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of 3DS hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY. If you have already hacked your 3DS before to get an EmuNAND setup, and would like to move the contents of your previous EmuNAND to your new SysNAND CFW, you should follow all instructions and restore your existing EmuNAND when prompted once you reach Finalizing Setup . This guide will work on New 3DS, Old 3DS, New 2DS, and Old 2DS in all regions and all versions, including the latest version (11.14.0). If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved). Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off! Your SD card should be MBR, not GPT (the SD card that comes with your device will be MBR by default). The easiest way to test this is to check if the SD card works in your 3DS. If it works, the SD card is MBR. If you need to format a brand new SD card, you can format it to FAT32 using guiformat (Windows) , Disk Utility (Mac) , or cfdisk (Linux) . The Old 2DS is essentially identical to the Old 3DS in terms of software, while the New 2DS is essentially identical to the New 3DS in terms of software. Any steps which say \"Old 3DS\" also apply to Old 2DS, and any steps which say \"New 3DS\" also apply to New 2DS. In order to follow this guide, you will need to be able to put files onto the SD card.

Is my device hackable? A: Yes Q: How do I update Luma3DS? A: Copy the boot.firm and boot.3dsx files from the latest release of Luma3DS to the root of the SD card, replacing any existing files. Q: I heard about this thing I have to pay for (Gateway, Sky3DS, etc). Is that something I need? A: No. boot9strap is a superior method of loading hax that runs early in boot. Q: How do I move saves from an existing Gateway setup to device installed games? A: See this Q: How risky is hacking my console? A: Bricks are now basically impossible unless you ignore/circumvent all safety checks. Q: Can I run awesome homebrew and emulators with this? A: Yes! Custom Firmware not only enables the Homebrew Launcher, but it also will give you hacks on all versions, which means you keep it forever, even with updates. Q: Can I use this to play games from other regions? A: Luma3DS supports Region Free patches, which enables users to install games from any region without any extra modification or steps. Q: Is it safe to update CFW SysNAND? A: Yes. This is safe, stop asking about it. Q: Where should I go for support? A: For support (in English), ask for help at Nintendo Homebrew on Discord . Q: Can I do this with a 4GB (or smaller) SD card? A: Yes! Q: Can I use a 128GB (or larger) SD card? A: Yes, but some users have reported slowdowns when using such large sizes. Note that you cannot format the card with exFAT; you need to format it with FAT32. Q: How do I move to a new SD card at the end of this? A: Just copy all the files to the new SD card. Q: Can I keep my NNID? A: If you start with an NNID and follow every step, you will end up keeping your NNID at the end. Q: What about System Transfers? A: Once you have completed the guide, you can system transfer to and from an B9S 3DS or 2DS exactly like you would a regular stock console or EmuNAND (you will lose any non-legitimate games/themes/DLC in the transfer; saves will stay even for games that are lost).

This file can be replaced at any time, although Luma3DS allows for the launch of other arm9 payloads in the FIRM format using the Luma3DS chainloader. In this case, we use Luma3DS by LumaTeam to boot a patched SysNAND directly, allowing us to completely bypass the need for any kind of EmuNAND, vastly simplifying the usage of a hacked 3DS in addition to saving SD card space.

The 3DS natively contains hardware to run such games, which is why VC Injects (which is what these are) are more desirable than emulators, as they automatically get better performance and compatibility. Running DS Games If you wish to run Nintendo DS (ie \"old DS\") games, you should use TWiLightMenu++ instead. This page will use Pokemon Emerald as an example to create a Virtual Console for the Game Boy Advance. Broadly speaking, the steps will not differ too much for other supported VC injectable consoles. Instructions To begin, open New Super Ultimate Injector for 3DS.exe, and create a new project. Once the project loads, import your legally dumped GBA rom by navigating to it in the window that appears when you click this button. Most of the information about your rom will be automatically prefilled. You may customise it as you wish. The options are reasonably self-explanatory, however if you are unsure, hover your mouse over a box or button for a short explanation of what it does. Most of the customisation is up to you. You can pick a long and short name, change the game icon, choose a title ID, modify the CIA banner, etc, etc. If you are lazy, most of these options can be left unchanged, but you should click \"Download title screen from database\" under icon settings and banner settings in order to get a half decent icon and banner image that you don't have to go hunting for. Importantly, at this time, there is no way to change button mapping for a VC inject. Under \"Edit content options\" at the bottom, you can apply a hard reset and or a sleep patch, if you want to do that. Once you have finished customising your rom, export it. It can then be installed to your console via FBI, which by this point you should already have. Here is an example of what the database title screen import looks like on a console. It's pretty good, for something that takes no effort on the user's behalf. Important VC injects count as Home Menu titles.

Additionally, running NDS games with alternative out-of-region languages is supported by TWiLightMenu++ . To use the magnet links on this page, you will need a torrent client like Deluge .

Note that carts with a \"Time Bomb\" will no longer be able to launch .nds files when they detect that the system clock has passed a date determined by the flashcart firmware. One method to bypass this is to set the system clock to an earlier date. Flashcart Name Current Price \"Time Bomb\"? 3DS Versions? DSi Versions?

Ensure your flashcart is able to launch .nds files on your device before beginning. Some flashcarts may require firmware or \"kernel\" files to be copied to the flashcart SD card. Consult your specific flashcart's instructions for more information. Note that specific methods may have additional compatibility information. The usage of this exploit, regardless of flashing method, requires access to a small magnet if the target device is of a folding style (any 3DS family system that is not the old 2DS with a sleep switch). This is because the exploit requires your device to enter sleep mode while still having access to the buttons. Testing the magnet To test if a magnet will work, hold it on or around the (A)(B)(X)(Y) buttons while the device is powered on to see if it triggers sleep mode. If it does, both displays will go black as long as the magnet is held in that spot. Note that the flashcart will not be able to be used for its standard functions while the ntrboot exploit is installed on it (except for in the case of the Acekard 2i, which remains functional on NDS and custom firmware 3DS systems only ). This means that, for most flashcarts, it will not even display on the home menu. There are optional steps at the end of the ntrboot flashing instructions to remove it from your flashcart when you are done. Important Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to brick a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as NDS Card ) Methods Flashing ntrboot (3DS Single System) This method requires nothing more than your stock unhacked 3DS and a compatible flashcart.
